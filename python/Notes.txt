Observation space is the info taken in
In frozen lake 8x8, there are 64 spaces, with 4 actions (up, down, left, right)
For stardew fisher: 
	Observations:
		Location of fish
			Distance to top
			Distance to bottom
		Location of bar
			Distance to top
			Distance to bottom
		Difference in location

	Actions:
		Hold mouse
		Continue to hold
		Stop holding
		Do nothing
		
Q: array of [states][actions][probability, nextstate, reward, done]
isd is map into an array


self.observation_space = spaces.Discrete(self.nS), so the number of states = number of observations
States: frozen lake is map
Stardew:
