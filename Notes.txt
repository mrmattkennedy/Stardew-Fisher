TODO:
Base everything off monitor resolution.

Portability flow:
	Get window location and size.
	Program casts and waits
		While waiting, compare differences in screens (do so as percents).
		If large diff (size=?), look for color of fishing bar wood.
	Get bar size. if 400x30 instead of 550x40, ask to retrain model.
		Resize train images to be same relative size as window / fishing bar.
		Retrain model.
	
	Find bar based off model bitmask - Just change width of 1's relative to size.
	Run Q learning.
