# stardew_fisher
Fishes for me in stardew valley because I am lazy.

This project was made as a basic showcase of opencv image capturing and template matching.
I would have liked to write this in C#/.NET, but I only had access to my laptop which contains a 32gb drive with flash memory, and almost all of that is windows. So, python it is.

The problem I chose to approach is Stardew Valley fishing. Why? Because it's simple enough to run off a flash drive, 2D, and a 1-dimension problem. All are factors when considering I have no internet, so this is all on my knowledge.
